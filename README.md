# Solo OS

**Solo OS** is a modular, lightweight, and optimized Ubuntu-based operating system designed specifically for efficient machine learning model inference. It provides a flexible platform for deploying and managing inference engines, leveraging hardware accelerators, and ensuring high performance.

## Features

- **Optimized for Model Inference**: Enhanced performance for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other ML frameworks.
- **Modular Design**: Easily add or remove components based on your needs.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage to maximize efficiency.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Supports NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and other accelerators.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Integrated tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A machine with [Ubuntu Minimal ISO](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) as the base.
- Sufficient storage and a compatible GPU (optional but recommended).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
